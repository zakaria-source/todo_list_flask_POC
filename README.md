# Flask Web Application Project

Welcome to our Flask Web Application project! This application is the culmination of a 2-hour, hands-on course focused on teaching the basics of web application development using Python and the Flask framework. Designed as a practical introduction to Flask, this project incorporates several core technologies and concepts to create a fully functional web application.

## Description

This web application serves as a showcase of what can be achieved by combining Python with Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, and WTForms. Throughout the development process, we've implemented features demonstrating the power and flexibility of Flask in web development, including dynamic content rendering, database integration, and form handling.

## Features

- **Flask Application Setup:** Configured to run a Flask application efficiently and securely.
- **Template Rendering:** Utilizes Jinja2 templates to render dynamic content on the web pages.
- **Database Integration:** Incorporates SQLAlchemy and SQLite for robust data management and storage solutions.
- **Form Handling:** Implements WTForms for secure and efficient form processing.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- SQLite
- WTForms
- HTML/CSS for frontend design

## Setup and Installation

To get this application running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using:
